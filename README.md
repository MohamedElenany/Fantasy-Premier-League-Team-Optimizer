# Fantasy Premier League Team Optimizer

## Main Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop an optimizer using Gurobi in Python that reliably delivers the best possible Fantasy Premier League team composition. With over 11 million participants in the Fantasy Premier League, this tool aims to provide a competitive edge by dynamically adapting to the unpredictable nature of player performances and maximizing points within budget constraints. Fantasy Premier League, with its dynamic nature and unpredictable player performances, presents a unique challenge. The optimizer aims to utilize statistical techniques, optimization algorithms, and data-driven insights to systematically evaluate player selections, captaincy choices, and overall team composition, providing FPL enthusiasts with a powerful tool to enhance their performance in fantasy leagues.

## Problem Description and Formulation

### Data Gathering and Preprocessing

To fuel the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Optimizer, extensive data gathering and preprocessing were undertaken. The Premier League API and supplemental external data sources provided crucial information. Player statistics, team strengths, and matchday performances were collected and meticulously preprocessed. This involved handling missing data, standardizing formats, and extracting relevant features, ensuring a robust foundation for subsequent analysis and optimization.

### Objective Function Formulation

The heart of the optimization lies in the formulation of the objective function. LASSO regression was employed for feature selection, weighing attributes such as team strength, cost, minutes played, and goals scored differently for each player positionâ€”Goalkeepers (GK), Defenders (DEF), Midfielders (MID), and Forwards (FWD). The LASSO coefficients provided essential weights, shaping the utility function that evaluates player performance. Additionally, the Expected points for the upcoming gameweek, generated by the Premier League for every player, was integrated into the objective function. With a 90% weight on the LASSO aspect, emphasizing long-term decision-making based on players' consistent performance throughout the season, and a 10% weight on Expected points, acting as a forward-looking metric, the model takes into account short-term considerations by selecting players with an easier gameweek to optimize points. This balanced approach ensures a strategic blend of reliability and adaptability in player selections.

### Constraints

Numerically converting real-world constraints into mathematical expressions defined the boundaries of the optimization problem. The constraints encompassed squad composition, budget limitations, player allocation rules, and strategic elements like captaincy and substitutes. The intricate network of constraints mirrors the complexities of the Fantasy Premier League, ensuring the model adheres to the game's rules and strategic nuances.

## Results and Model Performance

Throughout the 2022-2023 season, the optimization model consistently proved its strategic edge in Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team management, accumulating a remarkable 2,487 points, closely approaching the highest-scoring team globally in the previous season, which scored 2,776 points. The model demonstrated stability, with weekly gameweek points ranging between 50 and 70 in most gameweeks, showcasing its adaptability in navigating the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the league. A highlight was the model's effective captaincy choices, with top-performing captains contributing significantly to the overall points tally.

## Applicability and Significance

The success of the optimization model in Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team management extends beyond the realm of sports analytics, demonstrating broad applicability and significant implications. The project showcases the potential of integrating statistical models and optimization techniques in decision-making processes. In the context of sports management, the project emphasizes leveraging historical performance data, incorporating forward-looking metrics, and considering real-time dynamics for effective team composition. This approach holds relevance for sports organizations aiming to optimize player selection and overall team performance.

The significance of this project lies in its potential to revolutionize decision-making processes by providing actionable insights from complex datasets. As data-driven decision-making becomes integral across industries, the methodologies employed here serve as a model for harnessing the power of data and optimization to achieve strategic objectives. In conclusion, the Fantasy Premier League optimization model not only offers a competitive advantage in FPL but also paves the way for broader applications of data-driven decision-making methodologies, contributing to the advancement of strategic planning and performance optimization.
